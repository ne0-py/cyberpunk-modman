## A cyberpunk style mod manager for Cyberpunk 2077 created with Python tkinter

The app requires user to provide the root directory of the game, and from that it will detect all installed mods for all
three categories namely, archive mods, red script mods and cyberengine tweaks.

The user can also delete and install new mods and launch the game or open Nexus mods from within the app.

This project was created as a way for me to learn python (hence, it isn't very modular or complex) in a fun way, and as an outcome I get my mod manager!
